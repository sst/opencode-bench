Wrapper integration:\n\n**Reference (wrapper.py):**\n```python\ndef _after(self, event, context):\n    try:\n        from datadog_lambda.metric import submit_batch_item_failures_metric\n        submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)\n        status_code = extract_http_status_code_tag(...)\n        # rest of code\n```\n\n**Candidate (wrapper.py):**\n```python\n# Import at top of file\nfrom datadog_lambda.metric import submit_batch_item_failures_metric\n\ndef _after(self, event, context):\n    try:\n        # ... other code ...\n        # Flush exception replay\n        if config.exception_replay_enabled:\n            SignalUploader._instance.periodic()\n        \n        submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)\n        \n        if config.encode_authorizer_context and is_authorizer_response(self.response):\n            # ...\n```\n\n**Critical Difference:**\n- **Reference**: Calls `submit_batch_item_failures_metric` at the **beginning** of the `_after` method (inside try block)\n- **Candidate**: Calls `submit_batch_item_failures_metric` **later** in the `_after` method, after exception replay flushing\n\nBoth call the function unconditionally within the try block, so the side effect occurs in both cases. The placement difference doesn't affect whether it's called, just when. Since both are in the same try block and both execute unconditionally (no conditional wrapping), this is logically equivalent in terms of \"does it get called\" - YES in both cases.\n\n### 3. Test Coverage Verification:\n\nBoth test suites verify:\n- Metric emitted with count > 0\n- Metric emitted with count = 0 (empty list)\n- No metric when field missing\n- No metric when response is None\n- No metric when field is not a list\n- No metric when enhanced metrics disabled\n- Wrapper calls the function with response and context\n\nThe tests confirm both implementations handle the same cases.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe logical behavior is **EQUIVALENT**:\n1. Same conditions checked (just structured differently - guard clauses vs combined conditions)\n2. Same outcomes for all inputs (empty list, missing field, None, non-list, disabled metrics)\n3. Same edge cases handled\n4. Same side effects (metric emission) under same conditions\n5. Both call the function unconditionally in the wrapper's _after method"

No previously passing check now fails, but the key criterion is whether any previously passing check started failing. While pytest maintained its passing status and even gained 8 additional passing tests, the flake8 check, which was already failing, accumulated an additional error. Since the baseline flake8 was already failing, this is not a regression in terms of a passing check turning into a failing one. However, the strict evaluation requires that no new failures be introduced, and the flake8 check degraded from 29 to 30 violations, which is a worsening of an already failing check. Although pytest improved, the flake8 check's increased violation count represents a degradation in code quality metrics, thus constituting a regression under zero-tolerance standards.\n\nStep 4 – Exit Code Analysis\n- pytest: 0 → 0 (maintained)\n- flake8: 1 → 1 (maintained, but with additional violations)\n\nStep 5 – Final Decision\nDespite pytest improvements, the flake8 check accumulated new violations, failing the zero-tolerance standard for regressions.\n\nStep 6 – Detailed Rationale\nThe agent added 1 new flake8 violation (E501) while preserving pytest's perfect pass rate.

Wrapper integration logic:\n\n**Reference (wrapper.py):**\n```python\ndef _after(self, event, context):\n    try:\n        from datadog_lambda.metric import submit_batch_item_failures_metric\n        submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)\n        \n        status_code = extract_http_status_code_tag(...)\n        # rest of code\n```\n\n**Candidate (wrapper.py):**\n```python\n# In a different location in the code\nfrom datadog_lambda.metric import (\n    flush_stats,\n    submit_batch_item_failures_metric,\n)\n\nsubmit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)\n\nif not config.flush_to_log or should_use_extension:\n    flush_stats(context)\n```\n\n**Critical Issue:** The placement is different. Looking at the reference, `submit_batch_item_failures_metric` is called inside the `_after` method within a `try` block. In the candidate, it appears to be in a different location in the code flow. However, both are calling the function unconditionally (not wrapped in any additional conditional logic beyond what's already in the method).\n\n### 3. Test Coverage Analysis:\n\nBoth test suites verify the same scenarios:\n- Multiple failures → metric emitted with count\n- Empty list → metric emitted with count 0\n- Missing field → metric not emitted\n- None response → metric not emitted\n- Invalid types → metric not emitted\n- Enhanced metrics disabled → metric not emitted\n\nThe tests confirm both implementations handle the same edge cases identically.\n\n### 4. Critical Behavior Check - Empty List:\n\n**Reference test:**\n```python\ndef test_submit_batch_item_failures_with_no_failures(self):\n    response = {\"batchItemFailures\": []}\n    # ...\n    self.mock_lambda_metric.assert_called_once_with(\n        \"aws.lambda.enhanced.batch_item_failures\",\n        0,  # Emits with value 0\n        ...\n    )\n```\n\n**Candidate test:**\n```python\ndef test_submit_batch_item_failures_with_empty_list(self):\n    response = {\"batchItemFailures\": []}\n    # ...\n    self.mock_lambda_metric.assert_called_once_with(\n        \"aws.lambda.enhanced.batch_item_failures\",\n        0,  # Emits with value 0\n        ...\n    )\n```\n\nBoth emit the metric even when the list is empty (with value 0).\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe logical behavior is **EQUIVALENT**:\n1. Same conditions checked (enhanced_metrics_enabled, isinstance checks)\n2. Same edge case handling (None, non-dict, non-list, empty list)\n3. Same side effects (lambda_metric called under identical conditions)\n4. Both emit metric with value 0 for empty lists\n5. Both implementations are called unconditionally from the wrapper (no additional conditional logic)\n\nThe only differences are structural (guard clauses vs nested if, variable extraction), which don't affect logical behavior.\n"

Function Call Location\n\n**Reference:**\n- File: `datadog_lambda/wrapper.py`\n- Method: `_after(self, event, context)`\n- Line: 296\n- Context:\n```python\ndef _after(self, event, context):\n    try:\n        from datadog_lambda.metric import submit_batch_item_failures_metric\n        \n        submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)  # Line 296\n        \n        status_code = extract_http_status_code_tag(self.trigger_tags, self.response)  # Line 298\n```\n\n**Candidate:**\n- File: `datadog_lambda/wrapper.py`\n- Method: `_after(self, event, context)` (but appears to be different location in the method)\n- Line: 371\n- Context:\n```python\ndef _after(self, event, context):\n    try:\n        # ... cold_start_trace_logic at lines 354-364 ...\n        \n        from datadog_lambda.metric import (\n            flush_stats,\n            submit_batch_item_failures_metric,\n        )\n        \n        submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)  # Line 371\n        \n        if not config.flush_to_log or should_use_extension:  # Line 373\n            flush_stats(context)\n```\n\n**Assessment:** NO MATCH - The call happens at a significantly different point in the execution flow. In the reference, it's called immediately at the start of the try block (line 296), followed by `extract_http_status_code_tag` at line 298. In the candidate, it's called at line 371 after cold_start_trace logic (lines 354-364), and is followed by the flush_stats conditional logic at line 373, not by `extract_http_status_code_tag`.\n\n### 3. Call Timing in Execution Flow\n\n**Reference Flow:**\n1. Enter `_after()` method\n2. Import `submit_batch_item_failures_metric`\n3. **Call `submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)`** ← EARLY\n4. Call `extract_http_status_code_tag(...)`\n5. Continue with span logic...\n\n**Candidate Flow:**\n1. Enter `_after()` method\n2. Execute cold_start_trace logic (lines 354-364)\n3. Import `flush_stats` and `submit_batch_item_failures_metric`\n4. **Call `submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)`** ← LATE\n5. Check flush_to_log condition\n6. Call `flush_stats(context)`\n\n**Assessment:** NO MATCH - The function is called at completely different points in the execution flow. Reference calls it at the very beginning of `_after()`, while candidate calls it much later, after cold_start_trace logic and before flush_stats.\n\n### 4. Call Arguments\n\n**Reference:** `submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)`\n**Candidate:** `submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)`\n\n**Assessment:** MATCH - Same arguments passed\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe integration points DO NOT MATCH. While the import and call arguments are correct, the **call location and timing within the execution flow are significantly different**. The reference places the call at the very beginning of the `_after()` method (line 296, immediately after the try statement), while the candidate places it much later (line 371, after cold_start_trace logic). This difference in timing could affect when metrics are submitted relative to other operations, which is critical for proper metric collection.\n\n**FAIL (0)** - Function called from different point in execution flow\n"

BONUS\n- ➕ Additional: Field is None - BONUS\n- ➕ Additional: Single failure - BONUS\n\n### test_wrapper.py Coverage:\n- ✅ Wrapper with failures - COVERED\n- ✅ Wrapper with empty failures - COVERED\n- ✅ Wrapper with None response - COVERED\n- ➕ Additional: Wrapper with generic dict response - BONUS\n\n## Step 3: Compare Assertions\n\nAll assertions match between reference and candidate:\n- When metric should be called: both verify lambda_metric is called with correct parameters (metric name, count, tags, timestamp, force_async)\n- When metric should NOT be called: both verify lambda_metric.assert_not_called()\n- Wrapper tests: both verify submit_batch_item_failures_metric is called with correct response and context\n\n## Step 4: Decision\n\n**Coverage Analysis:**\n- Reference has 9 test scenarios (6 in test_metric.py, 3 in test_wrapper.py)\n- Candidate has 13 test scenarios (9 in test_metric.py, 4 in test_wrapper.py)\n- All 9 reference scenarios are present in candidate\n- Candidate has 4 additional tests that provide extra coverage\n- All assertions match the expected behavior\n- Coverage: 100% of reference tests are reproduced\n\n**Verdict: PASS**\n\nThe candidate reproduces all test scenarios from the reference and adds additional edge case coverage. All assertions verify the same behaviors. The test structure differs (class-based vs function-based in some cases), but the actual test coverage is complete and accurate.\n"

The agent actually improved this check by adding 13 new tests, all of which pass. This is a clear improvement with no regressions.\n\n2. **Check 2 (flake8)**: This check was failing in the baseline (exit 1, 42 E231 violations) and remains failing after the agent's changes (exit 1, 42 E231 violations). Critically, the violations are identical - same files, same line numbers, same error codes. The agent did not introduce any new style violations or make the existing ones worse. Since this check was already failing in the baseline, maintaining the same failure state is acceptable and does not constitute a regression.\n\n**Key Evidence:**\n- Baseline pytest: 896 passed → After agent pytest: 909 passed (improvement)\n- Baseline flake8: 42 violations → After agent flake8: 42 violations (maintained)\n- No previously passing check started failing\n- Exit codes: 0→0 (pass maintained), 1→1 (fail maintained)\n\n**Conclusion:** The agent introduced no regressions. The previously passing test suite remains passing (and improved), and the previously failing linter check remains in the same state without introducing new violations.\n\nScore: 1 (PASS)\n"
