  Product wants a quick-glance Duration readout and an uptime percentage on the
  detector details page so on-call engineers can see historical performance
  without leaving the detector view. The agent should hydrate those summaries
  using the existing uptime summary endpoint, show a placeholder while loading,
  handle missing data gracefully, and expand the relevant tests/specs to cover
  the new sections.
