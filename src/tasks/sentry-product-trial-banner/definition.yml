  Business plan customers should not see an "upgrade your plan" prompt when
  their unlimited product trials expire. Update the product trial alert so it
  varies the copy depending on whether the organization is on a Business plan,
  Team plan, or free plan, and ensure the trial-ended button logic stays the
  same.
