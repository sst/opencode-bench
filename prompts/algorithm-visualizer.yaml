    prompt: Bump the application version to 1.6.0 and update the documentation to reflect the new release. Add a changelog entry for version 1.6.0 dated Oct 15, 2024 that documents the Floyd Warshall algorithm implementation, loading state management during algorithm execution, and error handling for development mode. Update the README to include Floyd Warshall in the list of shortest path algorithms alongside Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's. Clean up minor formatting inconsistencies in the README as needed. Ensure all version references are consistent across package metadata and documentation.

    prompt: Add the Floyd Warshall algorithm tag to the dashboard schema data. Insert a new entry for Floyd Warshall in the projects data array, positioned after the Bellman Ford entry. Follow the existing pattern for algorithm entries (each should have a unique id generated by uid() and a name field). Ensure the change is consistent with the existing data structure and formatting.

    prompt: "Refine the pathfinding UI layout and component structure. Change the default selected algorithm from 'shortest-path' to 'unique-path'. Reorder the algorithm dropdown options so 'Unique Path' appears first, followed by 'No of island', then 'Shortest Path'. Adjust the layout hierarchy and responsive breakpoints: move speed and grid size controls to align right and group them more cohesively, update responsive breakpoints from 410px to 600px where appropriate, and adjust positioning for the shortest path status plate to use absolute positioning on larger screens. Replace wrapping container divs with fragments in the UniquePath and NoOfIslands components to simplify the DOM structure. Ensure the layout remains responsive and visually consistent across all pathfinding algorithm views."
