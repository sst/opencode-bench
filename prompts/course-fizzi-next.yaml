  - commit: 67de95355a2f2952eefd7668c07759fbbb3cf935
    prompt: Remove the documents folder and all its contents. This folder contains cached or generated Prismic document data that should no longer be tracked in version control. Delete both the locale-specific document JSON files and the index signature file.

    prompt: Replace the existing migration script with a new content setup script that automates the full workflow. The new script should handle authentication automatically (prompting the user to log in via a browser URL if not already authenticated), fetch all documents from a source Prismic repository (using the package name), copy them to the target repository defined in the Slice Machine config, and provide clear console feedback at each step including a final message with the migration release URL. Remove the old migration script file and any stale document cache files. Update the package name from the starter template name to "fizzi" to match the project. The script should be production-ready and handle the login flow gracefully.

    prompt: Add a new npm script named "set-up-content" that runs the set-up-content script using npx tsx. The script should execute "npx tsx@latest set-up-content". Place it in the scripts section of package.json following the existing script organization pattern.

    prompt: 'Update the README to provide comprehensive onboarding instructions. Replace the minimal existing content with a full introduction explaining that this is the final code for a YouTube tutorial course building a 3D animated e-commerce landing page for Fizzi, a fictional soda brand. Keep the existing link to course documentation but update its context. Add a new section titled "Skip the tutorial and launch the site" that provides step-by-step instructions for users who want to deploy their own version without following the tutorial. The steps should cover: cloning the code using the Prismic starter command, selecting the English locale in the Prismic repository, running the content setup script, publishing the migration release, and configuring the slice simulator URL. Use clear numbered steps and include the specific commands and URLs as code blocks where appropriate.'
