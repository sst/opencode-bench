  issues: []
  context: >
    Maintainer note: keep the prompt high-level. Mention only that the async CLI
    calls a blocking update routine and that this mismatch causes crashes; do not
    reference specific crates, APIs, stack traces, or error strings. Focus on
    instructing the agent to move the blocking work off the async path while
    preserving existing behavior.

  prompts: prompts/sentry-uptime-detector.yaml
  issues: []
  context: >
    Product wants a quick-glance Duration readout and an uptime percentage on the
    detector details page so on-call engineers can see historical performance
    without leaving the detector view. The agent should hydrate those summaries
    using the existing uptime summary endpoint, show a placeholder while loading,
    handle missing data gracefully, and expand the relevant tests/specs to cover
    the new sections.

    Business plan customers should not see an “upgrade your plan” prompt when
    their unlimited product trials expire. Update the product trial alert so it
    varies the copy depending on whether the organization is on a Business plan,
    Team plan, or free plan, and ensure the trial-ended button logic stays the
    same.
