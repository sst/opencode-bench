  issues: []
  context: >
    Maintainer note: keep the prompt high-level. Mention only that the async CLI
    calls a blocking update routine and that this mismatch causes crashes; do not
    reference specific crates, APIs, stack traces, or error strings. Focus on
    instructing the agent to move the blocking work off the async path while
    preserving existing behavior.

  issues: []
  context: >
    Product wants a quick-glance Duration readout and an uptime percentage on the
    detector details page so on-call engineers can see historical performance
    without leaving the detector view. The agent should hydrate those summaries
    using the existing uptime summary endpoint, show a placeholder while loading,
    handle missing data gracefully, and expand the relevant tests/specs to cover
    the new sections.
