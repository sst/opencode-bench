  Maintainer note: keep the prompt high-level. Mention only that the async CLI
  calls a blocking update routine and that this mismatch causes crashes; do not
  reference specific crates, APIs, stack traces, or error strings. Focus on
  instructing the agent to move the blocking work off the async path while
  preserving existing behavior.
