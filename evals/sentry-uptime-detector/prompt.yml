      Add Duration and Uptime percentage sections to the uptime detector details page. These sections should display quick-glance metrics for on-call engineers to see historical performance without leaving the detector view.

      Fetch uptime summary data using the existing uptime summary endpoint for the current detector. While the data is loading, show a placeholder. If no data is available for the detector, display a dash ("-"). When data is present, render the average duration and uptime percentage using the appropriate display components.

      The Duration section should show the average duration from the summary data. The Uptime section should show the uptime percentage calculated from the summary's check counts, with a note explaining it represents the last 90 days.

      Update the test suite to cover:
      - Rendering the Duration section with data
      - Rendering the Uptime section with percentage calculated from check counts
      - Mock the uptime summary endpoint in existing tests that render uptime detectors
      - Adjust assertions that count "Uptime" text occurrences to account for the new section heading

      Follow existing patterns in the codebase for layout, loading states, and component integration.
