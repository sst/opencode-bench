However, the candidate diff only shows the import statement being added but does NOT show the actual function call. This is a critical omission because without this call, the metric submission function will never be invoked during Lambda execution.\n\n**Reference wrapper.py:**\n```python\ndef _after(self, event, context):\n    try:\n        from datadog_lambda.metric import submit_batch_item_failures_metric\n\n        submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)  # <-- CRITICAL CALL\n\n        status_code = extract_http_status_code_tag(self.trigger_tags, self.response)\n```\n\n**Candidate wrapper.py:**\n```python\ndef _after(self, event, context):\n    try:\n        from datadog_lambda.metric import submit_batch_item_failures_metric\n        \n        status_code = extract_http_status_code_tag(self.trigger_tags, self.response)\n```\n\nThe candidate is missing the actual invocation of `submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)`.\n\n**Other Differences:**\nWhile the candidate implementation in `metric.py` has more verbose logging (which is an implementation detail), the core logic is equivalent. The test files are not shown in the candidate diff, but the missing function call in wrapper.py is a fundamental behavioral difference that would cause all the wrapper tests to fail.\n\nThis is a FAIL because the metric submission function is never actually called in the Lambda execution flow, making the entire feature non-functional."

The candidate splits the validation into separate checks with debug logging, while the reference combines them. Both achieve the same result: only submit metric if response is dict, batchItemFailures exists, and is a list. The debug logs are implementation details.\n\n### wrapper.py - Integration point\n**Reference:** Adds call in `_after` method at line 294-296\n**Candidate:** Adds call in `_after` method at line 367-369\n\nBoth import the function and call `submit_batch_item_failures_metric(self.response, context)` in the same method. The line numbers differ but this is expected due to different code context.\n\n## Test Code Analysis\n\n### test_metric.py\nBoth test suites cover the same scenarios:\n1. ✅ Multiple failures (3 items in reference, 3 items in candidate)\n2. ✅ Empty failures list\n3. ✅ Missing batchItemFailures field\n4. ✅ None response\n5. ✅ Invalid response type (non-dict)\n6. ✅ Invalid field type (non-list)\n7. ✅ Enhanced metrics disabled\n8. ✅ Single failure (candidate adds this extra test)\n9. ✅ Response with other fields (candidate adds this extra test)\n\nThe candidate has MORE test cases than the reference, which is acceptable. All reference test scenarios are covered.\n\n**Assertion differences:**\n- Reference uses `mock_get_tags` patch and checks exact tag values\n- Candidate uses `get_mock_context()` and checks call structure differently\n\nBoth verify the same observable behavior: that `lambda_metric` is called with correct parameters.\n\n### test_wrapper.py\n**Reference tests:**\n1. `test_batch_item_failures_metric` - with failures\n2. `test_batch_item_failures_metric_no_failures` - empty list\n3. `test_batch_item_failures_metric_no_response` - None response\n\n**Candidate tests:**\n1. `test_wrapper_calls_batch_item_failures_metric_with_failures` - with failures\n2. `test_wrapper_calls_batch_item_failures_metric_with_empty_list` - empty list\n3. `test_wrapper_calls_batch_item_failures_metric_without_failures` - different response\n4. `test_wrapper_calls_batch_item_failures_metric_with_none_response` - None response\n5. `test_wrapper_calls_batch_item_failures_metric_with_exception` - exception case\n\nThe candidate covers all reference scenarios plus additional edge cases (exception handling). The reference uses simple function-based tests with `@patch` decorator, while candidate uses class-based tests with setUp. Both verify that `submit_batch_item_failures_metric` is called with the response and context.\n\n## Key Observations\n1. ✅ Same function signature: `submit_batch_item_failures_metric(response, lambda_context)`\n2. ✅ Same metric name: `aws.lambda.enhanced.batch_item_failures`\n3. ✅ Same validation logic (equivalent implementation)\n4. ✅ Same integration point in wrapper\n5. ✅ All reference test scenarios covered\n6. ✅ Same external API calls (lambda_metric with same parameters)\n\nThe differences are purely implementation details (debug logging, test structure, variable names) that don't affect observable behavior. The candidate actually provides MORE comprehensive testing."

All previously passing checks remain passing, satisfying the criteria for a 1 (PASS)."
